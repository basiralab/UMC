		Scaling parameter used in extraction of "GW" feature vectors. It is used if feat_method=='GW', otherwise discarded.
		It adjusts the radius of the local network neighborhoods to be discovered. If it is large, larger local neigborhoods

		It adjusts the radius of the local network neighborhoods to be discovered. If it is large, larger local neigborhoods

	corr : 'hard' (default) or 'soft',
		correspondence strategy used in feature extraction phase. If 'hard', correspondence of a node
		in a graph is entirely reserved to the closest cluster centroid that is generated by KMeans clustering
		(correspondence: 1) and the correspondences to the other centroids are set to 0. If 'soft',
